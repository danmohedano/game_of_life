## Usage
A file can be used to prepopulate the grid with alive cells. Once the program is running, the user has the following options to control the display:
- Arrow keys: allow the user to move the camera in the grid.
- PageUp & PageDown: allow the user to zoom in and out.
- Space: pause/resume the execution.
- Mouse: allows the user to change the value of cells by clicking on them.

## Future updates
- ~~User input with mouse to prepopulate the grid instead of using a file.~~ [27/06/2021]
- ~~Pause and resume functionality.~~ [25/06/2021]
- Reverse and step execution
- Improve display performance
